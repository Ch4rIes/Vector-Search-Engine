# Search Engine

This project is a simple search engine that allows users to search for documents based on keywords. The backend is implemented using Python and the Flask framework, while the frontend is built using React.

# Features

Search for documents based on keywords
Backend uses OOP to design the search engine class
REST API endpoints set up with Flask
The search algorithm embeds the text into vectors in a certain space, then compares the cosine similarity between the query and text to make a prediction

# Technologies Used
Python
Flask
React
# Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the backend directory and run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the necessary Python packages.
Run python app.py to start the Flask server.
Navigate to the frontend directory and run npm install to install the necessary Node.js packages.
Run npm start to start the React development server.
Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000 to view the application.
Usage
To use the search engine, enter a keyword into the search bar and click the "Search" button. The search results will be displayed as a list of documents in the frontend. Clicking on a document will open a modal displaying the full document.
